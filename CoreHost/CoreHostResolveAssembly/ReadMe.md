## CoreHostResolveAssembly

<!-- TODO: Write a brief abstract explaining this sample -->
This sample illustrates how to deploy a standalone CoreHost application that resolves the ArcGIS Pro location in order to load the dependent assemblies such as ArcGIS.Core.dll and ArcGIS.CoreHost.dll from the ArcGIS Pro install location.  
Except for the dynamic assembly loading logic this sample is identical to the "CoreHostSample".   
The references to ArcGIS.Core.dll and ArcGIS.CoreHost.dll in Visual Studio have the "Copy Local" property set to "false".

1. Download the Community Sample data (see under the "Resources" section for downloading sample data).  Make sure that the Sample data is unzipped in c:\data and "C:\Data\SDK\SDK.gdb" is available.
2. Open this solution in Visual Studio   
3. Click the build menu and select Build Solution.  
4. Specify a valid path to a file geodatabase as your debug command line parameter   
5. Click the Start button to run the console app.  
6. Note that the AppDomain is modified on startup to resolve the Assembly Paths for ArcGIS.Core.dll and ArcGIS.CoreHost.dll by using the ArcGIS Pro installation location.  
7. View the table definition in your file geodatabase
