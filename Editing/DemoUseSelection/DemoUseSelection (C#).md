## DemoUseSelection

<!-- TODO: Write a brief abstract explaining this sample -->
This sample shows two tools that are using keys to toggle into selection mode while the tool is active.<br />  
The first is the use of ActivateSelectAsync in conjunction with UseSelection in a couple of example editing tools.  
The two tools both do the same thing - a Difference operation against any selected polygons intersected by the sketch.<p />  
DifferenceTool 1 shows use of UseSelection = <b>true</b> and leverages built-in behavior of the SHIFT key to toggle the tool into selection mode.<br />  
DifferenceTool 2 also uses UseSelection = <b>true</b> and a custom key - "W" to toggle into select mode. It also shows how to handle the SHIFT key to prevent the default behavior from interfering with the tool's use of "W".<br />  
Developers can experiment by setting UseSelection to <b>false</b> to observe how that changes the behavior of the tools.<p />  
The second thing demonstrated by the sample is the use of <b>Project.Current.IsEditingEnabled</b> in-conjunction with <b>Project.Current.SetIsEditingEnabledAsync(true | false)</b> to detect if a project has editing enabled and to toggle editing on|off. This is new at <b>2.6</b>
