## DivideLines

<!-- TODO: Write a brief abstract explaining this sample -->
This sample provides a tool that divides a line into an equal number of parts or a number of parts of a given length.  
The sample creates a map tool that is similar to other editing tools in the Modify Features pane, in that it opens a control within the pane with a dialog for user input. It follows the MVVM pattern used by the editing tools.
