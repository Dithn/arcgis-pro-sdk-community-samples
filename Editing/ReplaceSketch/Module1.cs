  /// This sample adds the ReplaceSketch command to the sketch context menu. 
  /// This allows you to add the shape of a line or polygon to the edit sketch by right clicking on the feature and choosing this command.
  /// It is equivalent to the ArcMap editing sketch context menu item.
  /// The replace sketch functionality is useful when you want to create a sketch from an underlying feature.
  /// For example you may want to split a polygon using an underlying road or stream geometry. 
  /// </summary>
  /// <remarks>
  /// 1. Download the Community Sample data(see under the "Resources" section for downloading sample data).  Make sure that the Sample data is unzipped in c:\data and "C:\Data\FeatureTest\FeatureTest.aprx" is available.
  /// 1. In Visual Studio click the Build menu.Then select Build Solution.  
  /// 1. Launch the debugger to open ArcGIS Pro.  
  /// 1. The project used for this sample is 'C:\Data\FeatureTest\FeatureTest.aprx'  .  
  /// 1. In ArcGIS Pro select the FeatureTest.aprx project.  
  /// 1. Select the polygon to split that already has a line going through the polygon and activate the editor split tool to 'split' the polygon.
  /// ![UI](Screenshots/Screenshot1.png)  
  /// 1. Right-click over the line since clicking close to the line will select that line for the 'sketch replacement'.  
  /// ![UI](Screenshots/Screenshot2.png)  
  /// 1. And select ReplaceSketch this will replace your current sketched geometry with the geometry of the polyline under the right mouse click.
  /// ![UI](Screenshots/Screenshot3.png)  
  /// 1. Continue or adjust the sketch as necessary then finish the sketch to use it as the splitting line.
