## ReplaceSketch

<!-- TODO: Write a brief abstract explaining this sample -->
This sample adds the ReplaceSketch command to the sketch context menu.   
This allows you to add the shape of a line or polygon to the edit sketch by right clicking on the feature and choosing this command.  
It is equivalent to the ArcMap editing sketch context menu item.  
The replace sketch functionality is useful when you want to create a sketch from an underlying feature.  
For example you may want to split a polygon with an underlying road or stream.
