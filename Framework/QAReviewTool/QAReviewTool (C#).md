1. Download the Community Sample data(see under the 'Resources' section for downloading sample data). Make sure that the Sample dataset is unzipped under c:\data and that the sample data contains the folder C:\Data\QAReviewTool containing a map package named "QA_Review_Tool.ppkx" which is required for this sample.
2. Open this solution in Visual Studio.  
3. Click the build menu and select Build Solution.  
4. Click the Start button to run the solution.  ArcGIS Pro will open.  
5. Open the map package "QA_Review_Tool.ppkx" located in the "C:\Data\QAReviewTool" folder.This project contains all required data.  Be sure the Topographic basemap layer is displayed.  
6. Click on the new "Review" tab provided by the add-in.  In the "Layer and Selection" group, click the dropdown button for the "Layer" combobox and select "La_Jolla_Roads".  Press the "Refresh Selection" button, which will enable the comboboxes in the "Field Setting" group.Then press the "Open Attribute Table" button and adjust the size of the table to where you can see around 3 or 4 records.

7. In the Field Setting group, click on the dropdown button for the "Value Field" and scroll to the bottom of the list and choose the field "review_code".  This will populate the "Value" field combobox with the unique data values from the review_code field.It will then zoom to the feature containing the value "1".  The forward and backward navigation buttons are now enabled, and you can click on these to zoom to the different records containing other review_code values.Click on "Show Selected Records" in the attribute table to just show the selected record(s).

8. In the "Note Field" combobox, choose the "QA_NOTE" from the list of available field names to store your QA notes.  It will ask if you would like to add the field to your data, and press "OK" to add it.Check to see that QA_NOTE is added at the end of your attribute table, and is also listed in the Note Field combobox.  This step will enable the rest of the controls on the Review tab.

9. You are now able to use the enabled Note Shortcuts to apply a brief description to any selected records.Use the "Forward" button to navigate to review_code value 3 and you will see three road features selected.  As the Topographic basemap layer does not show a street for these features, change the basemap to Imagery to see verify the data.  You will see the features represent the entrance driveway to a building and its parking lot.  Press the "Correct" note shortcut button to set the QA review value.
