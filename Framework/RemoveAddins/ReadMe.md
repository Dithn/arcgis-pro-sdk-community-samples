## RemoveAddins

<!-- TODO: Write a brief abstract explaining this sample -->
 This sample shows how to customize the backstage by adding a new tab.   
 In this example we will add a new tab in the backstage called Remove Add-Ins. Add-ins installed on that machine will be listed in that tab and you will be able to delete them.  
 Adding and removing add-ins requires an application restart to take effect.
