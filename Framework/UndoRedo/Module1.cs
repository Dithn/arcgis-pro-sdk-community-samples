    /// own operations are managed. In many cases, each pane and dockpane has it's own OperationManager; however in some cases they may 
    /// elect to share a single OperationManager.  For example, operations added to map A are not visible to map B (becuase they have different
    /// OperationManagers), but two panes showing the same map will show the same operations as they share the same OperationManager. 
    /// 
    /// When a window becomes active, its OperationManager is requested and connected to the undo/redo user interface.

    /// This sample contains a dockpane which has its own OperationManager.   The two buttons at the top of the dockpane illustrate how to 
    /// create an undo/redo operation and add it to the OperationManager.  The third button at the top of the dockpane illustrates a 
    /// compositeOperation which allows many operations to be grouped into a single composite operation.   The 4 buttons at the bottom of the 
    /// dockpane manipulate the undo/redo stack - performing undo and redo actions; remove undo actions and clearing the stacks.
