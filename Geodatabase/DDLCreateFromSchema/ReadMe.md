## DDLCreateFromSchema

<!-- TODO: Write a brief abstract explaining this sample -->
This sample creates a command line utility that takes 2 parameters:  
- a schema XML file (created using the Pro Export XML Workspace Document Geoprocessing tool with Export Options "Schema only")  
- a .SDE connection file that points to the target Geodatabase (with a user that has rights to create feature classes)  
  
The utility uses the CoreHost library and .NET to parse the XML file into an object structure that is then used  to create feature classes in the target geodatabase

## How to use the sample
<!-- TODO: Explain how this sample can be used. To use images in this section, create the image file in your sample project's screenshots folder. Use relative url to link to this image using this syntax: ![My sample Image](FacePage/SampleImage.png) -->
1. In Visual Studio click the Build menu. Then select Build Solution.
2. Set the Debug / Debug launch profile to have 2 parameters:   
- a path to an XML file that has the schema  
- a path to an SDE file that has the connection information for the target Geodatabase  
3. Click the Start button to start the utility with the provided parameters  
4. A command window will appear and its content will be descriptive of what the utility is doing  
5. Once successfully done the target geodatabase will contain the schema described in the XML file
