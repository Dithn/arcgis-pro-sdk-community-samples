## TextSymbols

<!-- TODO: Write a brief abstract explaining this sample -->
This sample creates custom text symbol items that you can use to label feature layers and Annotation layers.    
These text symbol items are stored in a personal style file in your project that you can re-use.   
Community Sample data (see under the "Resources" section for downloading sample data) has a TextSymbols.ppkx  project package that contains Annotation and Feature layers that can be used for this sample.   
This project package is can be found under C:\Data\TextSymbols folder. Alternatively, you can also use any Annotation and Feature layers to work with this sample.
