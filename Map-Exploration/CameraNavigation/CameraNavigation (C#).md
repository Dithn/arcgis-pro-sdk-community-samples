## How to use the sample
<!-- TODO: Explain how this sample can be used. To use images in this section, create the image file in your sample project's screenshots folder. Use relative url to link to this image using this syntax: ![My sample Image](FacePage/SampleImage.png) -->
1. In Visual Studio click the Build menu. Then select Build Solution.
2. Launch the debugger to open ArcGIS Pro.  
3. Open a map view. Click on the new Camera tab on the ribbon.  
4. Within this tab there is a Camera Properties button that when clicked will open the Camera Properties dockable window.  
![UI](Screenshots/Screenshot1.png)    
5. The dock pane will show each property of the camera for the active map view and its corresponding value.  
6. Change one or more of the values and use the zoom to or pan to commands to go to the new camera position.   
7. If there is no active MapView the Camera Properties Dockpane is disabled but still stays in the foreground.  The visibility of the 'Camera' tab and the 'Show Camera Properties' button are tied to the 'esri_mapping_mapPane' condition.
