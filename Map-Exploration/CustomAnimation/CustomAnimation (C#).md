6. Click the Follow Path button. This will create new keyframes that you can use to animate along the path.   
7. On the Animation tab click the Timeline button to see the animation timeline.  Click the Play button in the Animation tab to fly along the line.   
8. Additional options are available in the Path group on the Add-In tab to configure how the keyframes are created.  Experiment by  clicking the Clear Animation button on the Add-In tab to remove the existing keyframes, change a few of the options and click the Follow Path button to create a different set of keyframes. Play these animations to see the differences.
