## MapToolWithCustomPopup

<!-- TODO: Write a brief abstract explaining this sample -->
This sample shows how to author custom pop-up content to display in a pop-up window.   
In this example we are generating html and javascript code using the Google Charts api to create rich and interactive content in the pop-up.   
This example also shows how to add your own commands to the bottom of the pop-up window.
