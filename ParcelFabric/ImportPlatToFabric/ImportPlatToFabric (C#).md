2. In Visual Studio click the Build menu. Then select Build Solution.  
3. You can run the add-in using the debugger, but to see its full functionality you should run the add-in wihtout the debugger first since some of the functionality like Progress Dialogs are not supported when running ArcGIS Pro from the debugger.
