## TraceNetworkSample

<!-- TODO: Write a brief abstract explaining this sample -->
This console application demonstrates downstream trace from a Medium Voltage Transformer to Service Points on the Utility Network. Rather than coding particular logic to pick a starting point, the sample uses a known medium voltage transformer as a starting point for trace. The example illustrates a simple use case for using the Utility Network in the CoreHost application.  
The sample uses the NapervilleElectric.gdb, a file geodatabase available in the Community Sample data at C:\Data\UtilityNetwork (see under the "Resources" section for downloading sample data).  
You can also use any utility network data with this sample, although constant values may need to be changed.
