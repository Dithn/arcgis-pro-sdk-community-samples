1.

For details see [Manage workflow item connections](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/workflow/manage-workflow-item-connections.htm).
2. Prerequisite: Using Workflow Manager make sure you have at least one job created in your workflow item.  For details see [Create jobs](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/workflow/create-jobs.htm).  
3. In Visual Studio 2022 debug this add-in.  
4. After ArcGIS Pro opens, open Pro project that contains a Workflow Manager connection or add a Workflow Manager connection to the  project.  
5. Open the 'Workflow' dockpane if not already open using the 'View' tab and click on 'Workflow Manager'.  
6. You should see your jobs on the 'Workflow' dockpane.  
7. Feel free to engage with the Add-In which makes use of the first job in the search list. Some functionality is specific to certain Workflow Manager steps and will need to be configured specifically. Please refer to each example for more information.
